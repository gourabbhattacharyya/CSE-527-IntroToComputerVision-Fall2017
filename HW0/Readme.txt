S1. Components used:
---------------
    1.python3
    2.opencv3.3.0

S2. Executable file:
----------------
    1.Helloworld.py

S3. Output Window Names(results):
----------------------------
    1.Image Display - this will display the loaded image from the given file
    2.Image Add Operation - this will display the image after Add operation
    3.Image Subtract Operation - this will display the image after Subtract operation
    4.Image Multiply Operation - this will display the image after Multiply operation
    5.Image Division Operation - this will display the image after Division operation
    6.Image Resize Operation - this will display the image after Resizing by 1/2


S4. Execution steps:
----------------
    0. Extract the code from HW0.zip. Do cd to HW0.
    1. We are using the Dog.jpg file already included here. Please edit Helloworld.py at 'disp = Imageprocessing("Dog.jpg")' inside main to pass your own image file.
    2. Run the program as  'python3 Helloworld.py'. Keep pressing Enter to see the consecutive opertaions on image. If you do not press enter, window waits for 6 secs 
    before bringing up the next operated image window.
    4. Output will be displayed in different windows for all the specified operations as per S4 above.
    5. Once all windows are populated, the program breaks by itself.
